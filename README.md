# Language Learning — Learn by Narrating Your Life

**One-sentence value:** Learn a language by narrating your real life, instead of memorizing abstract phrases.

Most apps teach you how to order coffee. This teaches you how to think in the language about things you actually do every day.

## Who this is for (and who it's not)

**Ideal early users:** Busy adults (25–45) who tried Duolingo and bounced; want practical fluency, not gamified streaks; like systems and patterns; analytical learners (engineers, designers, PMs); people restarting a language who know some basics but can't use it.

**Not for (early):** Kids, hardcore polyglots, people who only respond to games/streaks, absolute beginners who need pictures of apples and cats.

## North star

> *"Can I make one habit feel powerful?"*

**Next step:** Build the first habit experience — landing → pick habit → two-screen verb flow (I need to ___ / I ___).
